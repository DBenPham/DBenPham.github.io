        <p>Dodge Ball is a survival game where you stay in a circle and try to<br> 
        dodge ball. The ball doesn't spawn in one place but randomly in one of<br>
        the corners.Every 10 seconds, the player obtains 100 points. After 7 <br>
        seconds, another ball will spawn. The game ends when the square is hit<br>
        by the ball.
        </p>
        <p>
            I chose to make the game because is simple to make but hard to play.<br>
            Two successful things about the game are that the balls spawn one <br>
            one at a time and stay bouncing until the game ends and the sprite <br>
            increases in size if out of the circle.Two obstacles were spawning a<br>
            single ball at a time and getting the ball to increase in size when <br>
            when out of the circle.I overcome these problems by setting a timer <br>
            after creating a clone and putting if a certain color increase.If I<br>
            had more time, I would of changed the difficulties since it is buggy<br>
            the harder it is.

        <p>This code repeats until the player is touch and if it is not, the game<br>
        will randomly choose a number from 1 to 4 and spawn more balls after a few<br>
        seconds in the specific random corner.</p>

            When my partner and I were calling the function, the function would 
            be called twice eventhough it was suppose to be called once. The 
            first thing we tried to do was putting an if statement before calling.
            That didn't work so we changed what the function returned and it worked.
            Another problem we encountered was using a variable outside of a function.
            We solved this by researching how variable worked when in functions 
            and we set the variables to global.

            Organizing scenes into functions is a form of procedual abstraction 
            since it allows people looking at the code to know events are triggered
            by what. The advantages of abstracting scenes into functions is to 
            easily find the scene if the person wants to edit it.

            One story I liked was the Bank Heist since it allowed the user to
            choose what role they are in which is citizen or police officer.
