        <p>Dodge Ball is a survival game where you stay in a circle and try to<br> 
        dodge ball. The ball doesn't spawn in one place but randomly in one of<br>
        the corners.Every 10 seconds, the player obtains 100 points. After 7 <br>
        seconds, another ball will spawn. The game ends when the square is hit<br>
        by the ball.
        </p>
        <p>
            I chose to make the game because is simple to make but hard to play.<br>
            Two successful things about the game are that the balls spawn one <br>
            one at a time and stay bouncing until the game ends and the sprite <br>
            increases in size if out of the circle.Two obstacles were spawning a<br>
            single ball at a time and getting the ball to increase in size when <br>
            when out of the circle.I overcome these problems by setting a timer <br>
            after creating a clone and putting if a certain color increase.If I<br>
            had more time, I would of changed the difficulties since it is buggy<br>
            the harder it is.

        <p>This code repeats until the player is touch and if it is not, the game<br>
        will randomly choose a number from 1 to 4 and spawn more balls after a few<br>
        seconds in the specific random corner.</p>
